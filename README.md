## Hey you! üëãüèª
I don't know how you got here but I hope you find something interesting that might be helpful for you.

## Here are some stuff about me:
- **Name:** Vin√≠cius Loureiro
- **Living in:** Brazil
- **Stack:** Docker, k8s, Terraform, Ansible, Gitlab CI/CD, AWS, GCP, Python and Golang.

## Curiosities:
- When I was younger I used to maintain a Transformice and Habbo server and tried to solve their bugs by just googling the error messages (sometimes it worked, sometimes not).
- I like producing learning content (like the "terraform-essentials" repo in my profile) to exercise my knowledge and simplify difficult topics through examples. I also use these contents as "simplified docs" whenever I forget something.
- I enjoy being part of communities and helping people during their learning journey.
